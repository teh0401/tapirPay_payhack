# 🐾 TapirPay — Offline-first Digital Payments for All

**TapirPay** is a secure, offline-capable digital payment system designed to empower **underserved communities**, **small businesses (MSMEs)**, and **ESG-driven consumers**. We focus on **connectivity-agnostic transactions**, **green merchant tracking**, and **privacy-respecting cryptography** — with a future-ready architecture for financial inclusion and sustainable impact.

> ⚠️ This project is a **Work In Progress**. Many features are in development and will be released incrementally. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
